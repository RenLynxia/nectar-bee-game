This is my simple project to make a game using Python. Below is the procedure.

Use the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard to move the bee.

How to Run This Game
Basic Requirements
Make sure you have Python and Pygame. If you don't, install Pygame with this command:

pip install pygame

Folder Setup
To have a smooth game, make sure all your files are organized as below:

Make sure the assets folder has all the files

Launch terminal or command prompt.

Go to the directory you stored the file.
