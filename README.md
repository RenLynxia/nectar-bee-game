Nectar Bee Game

I just added some screenshots regarding the info or snippets in or during the main menu and maybe in the future I will add some other features.
This is my simple project to make a game using Python. Below is the procedure.

How to Play
Use the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard to move the bee.

How to Run This Game
Basic Requirements
Make sure you have Python and Pygame. If you don't, install Pygame with this command:

pip install pygame

Folder Setup
To have a smooth game, make sure all your files are organized as below:

Nectar Bee Game/
├── Nectar Bee Game.py
└── assets/
    ├── background.png
    ├── background2.png
    ├── pixel_font.ttf
    ├── hit.wav
    └── nectar_collect.wav

Save the code (e.g., Nectar Bee Game.py) on your computer.

Make sure the assets folder has all the files

Launch terminal or command prompt.

Go to the directory you stored the file.

type python nectar bee game.py and enter

now you can play the game 

have fun :)

Enjoy!
